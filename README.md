# ðŸ‘“ Overview

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project demonstrating a small, rudimentary chat application created for the sake of a public lecture on Ktor. 
As such, this application does not follow certain best practices such as password encryption, so please do not use it as a foundation for another application.

# ðŸ”§ Setting up the Application

## PostgreSQL

This application uses PostgreSQL, so before you can run the app, you need to set PostreSQL.

To do so, do the following steps

1) Install PostgreSQL on your system. This is platform specific so this README won't go into further detail.
2) Set the following environment variables into your respective environment (OS):

    ```bash
    CHAT_SAMPLE_JWT_SECRET="secret"
    CHAT_SAMPLE_JWT_ISSUER="http://0.0.0.0:8080/"
    CHAT_SAMPLE_JWT_AUDIENCE="http://0.0.0.0:8080/authorized"
    CHAT_SAMPLE_JWT_REALM="Access to 'authorized'"
    
    CHAT_SAMPLE_USER_DB_NAME="chat_sample_user_database"
    CHAT_SAMPLE_USER_DB_USER_NAME="my_chat_sample_db_user"
    CHAT_SAMPLE_USER_DB_USER_PASSWORD="superSecretPassword"
    ```
3) Open your terminal:
   - Make sure postgres is running, e.g. on Linux: `systemctl status postgres`
   - Switch your shell user to `postgres`, you can do it via superuser command `sudo -i -u postgres`
   - Open the Postgres terminal frontend using `psql`
   - Create your user using `CREATE USER my_chat_sample_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'superSecretPassword;`
   - Create the user database using `CREATE DATABASE chat_sample_user_database WITH OWNER my_chat_sample_db_user;`

-----

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Web, Desktop, Server.

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code thatâ€™s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Appleâ€™s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if youâ€™re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

* `/server` is for the Ktor server application.

* `/shared` is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is `commonMain`. If preferred, you can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.
